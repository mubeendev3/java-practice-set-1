## Primitive Types

### Scenario 1: Temperature Conversion

Write a program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. Use `float` for temperature values.

### Scenario 2: Area and Perimeter Calculation

Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width using `int`.

### Scenario 3: Type Casting

Write a program that converts a `double` value to `int` and `float` and prints the results.

### Scenario 4: Character to ASCII

Write a program that takes a `char` input and prints its ASCII value.

### Scenario 5: Byte Overflow

Write a program to demonstrate overflow with `byte` by adding 1 to the maximum byte value (127) and observing the result.

## Operators

### Scenario 1: Arithmetic Operations

Write a program that takes two `int` values and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.

### Scenario 2: Compound Assignment

Write a program to demonstrate the use of compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) with `int` values.

### Scenario 3: Comparison Operations

Write a program that compares two `double` values using comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`).

### Scenario 4: Logical Operations

Write a program to check if a given year is both a leap year and an even number using logical operators.

### Scenario 5: Bitwise Operations

Write a program that performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on two `int` values.

## Flow Control Statements

### Scenario 1: Grade Classification

Write a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their grade based on the following criteria:

- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: Below 60

### Scenario 2: Leap Year Checker

Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.

### Scenario 3: Simple Calculator

Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) based on user input.

### Scenario 4: Day of the Week

Write a program that takes an integer (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week.

### Scenario 5: Find Maximum of Three Numbers

Write a program that takes three integers as input and prints the largest.

### Scenario 6: Factorial Calculation

Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a `for` loop.

### Scenario 7: Multiplication Table

Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number up to 10 using a `while` loop.

### Scenario 8: Sum of Digits

Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number using a `do-while` loop.

### Scenario 9: Fibonacci Sequence

Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a `for` loop.

### Scenario 10: Prime Numbers within a Range

Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using nested `for` loops.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desired Java file in your IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the program using your preferred method (e.g., `javac` and `java` commands).
